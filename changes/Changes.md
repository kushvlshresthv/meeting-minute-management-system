`HTTP OK`

``` json
{
    "message": null,
    "mainBody": {

    }
}
```


## 2. Invalid Request(when the committee requested is not available in the database)

`/api/getCommitteeDetails?committeeId=1`

`HTTP BAD REQUEST`
```json

}
```



# Previous Changes

## [1] Implemented /api/createCommittee (POST)

- createCommittee route accepts the request body of the following format: 

``` json
{
  "committeeName": "New Committee",
  "committeeDescription": "Committee formed to handle stuffs",
  "memberships": [
    {
      "member": {
        "memberId": 1
      }, 
      "role": "SECRETARY"
    },
    {
      "member": {
        "memberId": 2
      },
      "role": "MEMBER"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Here, the memberId must be present in the database. So the frontend should first request to the available members, and only populate the 'memberships' field, it should not populate the memberships field randomly. 

- Other than committeeName, the other fields are optional. A committee can be created with just a Committee Name

- If the memberships field has members, the members must have a valid memberId and a `valid ROLE` 


### Examples: 


### 1. Valid request

#### Request Body

``` json
{
  "committeeName": "New Committee",

        "memberId": 100

    },
    {
      "member": {
        "memberId": 2

    }
  ]
}
```

| 6. Confirm Password | Confirm Password can't be blank<br><br>Confirm Password and Password have to match |


- If any of the validation fails, the server will return `Http.BAD_REQUEST`

### Response for various Request body

#### [1] Proper Format: 

- The following json body is the proper valid format for the request body

REQUEST BODY: 

``` json
{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "username": "John",
    "email": "JohnDoe@gmail.com",
    "password":"johndoe",
    "confirmPassword":"johndoe"
}
```


RESPONSE BODY: 

``` json
HTTPSTATUS: OK
{
    "message": "User registered successfully",
    "mainBody": null
}
```


### [2] Invalid Format: FirstName is blank


REQUEST BODY: 

``` json
{
    "firstName": "",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "username": "John",
    "email": "JohnDoe@gmail.com",
    "password":"johndoe",
    "confirmPassword":"johndoe"
}
```

RESPONSE BODY: 

``` json
HTTPSTATUS: BAD_REQUEST
{
    "message": "Failed to register user",
    "mainBody": {
        "firstName": [
            "This field cannot be empty"
        ]
    }
}
```

>NOTE: Here the Response body JSON has two fields: `message` and `mainBody`.   `message` is a string and `mainBody` is another object(nested JSON) where each field of `mainBody` is an array of `Strings` (because a single field can have multiple validation failures as we will see below)


> NOTE: the behaviour will be the same even if the 'firstname' field is entirely removed from the JSON 

``` json
	 {
	    "lastName": "Doe",
	    "username": "John",
	    "email": "JohnDoe@gmail.com",
	    "password":"johndoe",
	    "confirmPassword":"johndoe"
	}
``` 


### [3] Invalid Format: Every field is blank

REQUEST BODY: 


``` json
{
    "firstName": "",
    "lastName": "",
    "username": "",
    "email": "",
    "password":"",
    "confirmPassword":""
}
```


RESPONSE BODY: 

``` json
HTTPSTATUS: BAD_REQUEST
{
    "message": "Failed to register user",
    "mainBody": {
        "lastName": [
            "This field cannot be empty"
        ],
        "firstName": [
            "This field cannot be empty"
        ],
        "password": [
            "Please choose a stronger password",
            "This field cannot be empty"
        ],
        "confirmPassword": [
            "This field cannot be empty"
        ],
        "email": [
            "This field cannot be empty"
        ],
        "username": [
            "This field cannot be empty"
        ]
    }
}
```


## Frontend Usage: 

1. make a form, take the user data from the form, create a JSON object, stringify the json object, attach the json object into the request body and send the request to the server. 

2. Server might respond with BAD_REQUEST or OK

	a.  If the response is HTTP_OK, then display: "Register Successful"
	b.  If the response is HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, then parse the ResponseBody, check which `fields` are presents in the ResponseBody, read the error Messages for those fields, and reopen the SAME form displaying the error messages

## [4] Moved to H2 Database

- H2 is a in memory database and the project no longer uses mysql(during development)

1) To view the database in the H2 database, first start the server, then go to: `localhost:8080/h2-console` and following page will appear

2) Don't write any password, just press `connect` button (because password is empty string) and the following page will appear

3)  All the databse tables can be viewed, queried from here. (click on `APP_USERS`) which is a database table. A query will appear, and then click `run`

> [!important] 
> Database is populated when the server is started with a `sql script` and new data won't be persisted when the server is turned off
